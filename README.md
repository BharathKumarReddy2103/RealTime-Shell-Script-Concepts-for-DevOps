## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Linux/Unix environment (tested on Ubuntu/CentOS)
- Bash shell (version 4.x or higher recommended)
- Basic system access and permissions (some scripts require `sudo`)
- Recommended utilities: [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), [`curl`](https://curl.se/), [`mailx`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/mailx) for alerting scripts

## 📦 Installation & Usage

Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BharathKumarReddy2103/shell-scripting-concepts-for-devops.git
cd shell-scripting-concepts-for-devops
```

Make a script executable and run it:
```sh
chmod +x monitoring/disk_check.sh
./monitoring/disk_check.sh
```

---

## 🖨️ Sample Output

Example output from `monitoring/disk_check.sh`:
```
[INFO] Disk Usage on /dev/xvda1: 67% (Threshold: 80%)
[OK] Sufficient disk space available.
```

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

- **Monitoring:** Alerting on high disk or CPU usage, checking memory consumption.
- **User Management:** Automating user creation/removal, permissions management.
- **Backups:** Scheduling and verifying file backups/restores.
- **Crontab Automation:** Automating recurring jobs (backups, cleanup, alerts).
- **Alerts:** Email/SMS notifications on critical events.

---

## 🛡️ Troubleshooting

- Ensure scripts have execution permissions (`chmod +x script.sh`).
- Some scripts require root privileges; use `sudo` as needed.
- For alert scripts, configure SMTP/mail on your server.
- Check shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) is present at the top of your scripts.
