# Real-Time Shell Scripting Concepts for DevOps Engineers

This repository contains **real-world Shell Scripts** that I actively use in my current DevOps role to automate tasks, manage Linux systems, perform monitoring, and streamline operations.

> 🧑‍💻 These are not just practice examples—they represent actual scripts and use cases from production and staging environments in my company. This repository reflects my day-to-day scripting experience in a real DevOps project.

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Automate routine system administration and DevOps tasks using Shell Scripting
- Showcase practical, reusable, and production-grade Bash scripts
- Help DevOps engineers, sysadmins, and learners understand real-world shell scripting patterns

## 📌 Example Script Usage

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x monitoring/disk_check.sh

# Run the script manually
./monitoring/disk_check.sh

# Schedule using crontab
0 * * * * /home/ec2-user/scripts/disk_check.sh >> /var/log/disk_check.log 2>&1
